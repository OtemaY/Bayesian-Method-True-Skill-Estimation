# APML

The aim of this project is to implement a Bayesian method for estimating the skill of players involved in a competition. This implementation is be based on the TrueSkill ranking system. After experimenting and selecting a proposed method, we evaluate this method on real-world data and compare alternative approaches. The first dataset we are using for this implementation is the Serie A division 2018/2019 dataset. Due to the nature of this dataset, we refer to, our 'players' as 'teams' within the Serie A football division.

Instructions about how to run the code:
